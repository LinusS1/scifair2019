Now more than ever California needs stronger protections for the Mojave Desert. I agree with Senator Roth–we can't turn a blind eye to Cadiz’s scheme to profit from robbing the desert of its most precious resource: water https://twitter.com/GeneralRoth/status/1115445820365520896 ….,0
"In addition, it’s unnecessary and divisive. It divides members on this committee and is focused on overturning the constitutional rights of women.",0
I’m really concerned that the Judiciary Committee is spending time on legislation to limit access to reproductive health care – legislation that has failed to pass the Senate on more than one occasion – and will not move in this Congress as well.,0
Thank you@HerbanLifestyle for supporting the Personal Care Products Safety Act. Higher quality products are better for consumers AND business.,0
"Sad to hear about the death of Senator Fritz Hollings. An amazing story: WWII officer, governor and one of the longest-serving senators ever. A champion for South Carolina, he’ll be missed.",0
Trump’s decision to cut funding to Northern Triangle countries will only increase the number of people fleeing poverty and violence. His ill-thought-out policies pose serious risks to our national security and threatens bipartisan efforts to address immigration to the U.S.,0
I also ask for more information about what the California Horse Racing Board is doing to both investigate this matter and address some of the concerns that these incidents have rightly raised.,0
"The death of a single horse is a tragedy, but as a lifelong lover of horses, I’m appalled that almost two dozen horses have died in just four months. I believe that racing at Santa Anita should be suspended until the cause or causes of these deaths can be fully investigated.",0
Thanks to@TheSoapGuild for supporting the reintroduction of the Personal Care Products Safety Act. It’s time to enact meaningful regulation of personal products to protect consumers.,0
"Reports that members of Mueller’s team are “frustrated with the limited information” Attorney General Barr has provided and his characterization of the report show precisely why Congress needs to receive the full, unredacted Mueller report as soon as possible.",0
Congress has already demanded and received considerable classified and law-enforcement sensitive information even while the investigation is ongoing. There’s no reason to withhold information now.,0
I’m pleased the House passed its VAWA reauthorization bill with meaningful improvements. I’m also thrilled the bill passed with 33 Republican votes – this shouldn’t be a partisan issue. I look forward to working with@SenJoniErnst on this and hope the Senate will follow soon.,0
I know@SenatorBennet will face this cancer diagnosis with the same dogged determinism he brings to the Senate. He’s a fighter and I know this won’t slow him down at all. Sending my best wishes to him and his family.,0
A single California fishery that still uses these driftnets kills more dolphins and porpoises than all other West Coast and Alaska fisheries combined. California thankfully removed harmful driftnets from its coastal waters but we must extend those protections into federal waters.,0
NEW: Our bill to protect marine life from large mesh driftnets was just passed in committee. Thank you@SenCapito for helping move this much-needed bipartisan legislation https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=943603D6-6D7B-47FB-A6AB-1249870A12F8 ….,0
"As climate change continues, severe droughts will become more frequent. We must work together to ensure the Colorado River remains a sustainable water source for all. That’s why all 14 senators from the Colorado River Basin introduced a new drought contingency plan.",0
"Republicans breaking Senate rules is just the latest effort to pack the federal court system with young, conservative ideologues. Republicans are already moving these nominees quickly. In fact, the average debate time for judicial nominees is just 3.1 hours.",0
"Republicans have achieved this record pace by killing the blue slip, ignoring home-state senators, pushing multiple nominees per hearing & failing to thoroughly vet unqualified nominees. Now they say they must break the rules to move nominees even faster. There is no obstruction.",0
"In President Trump’s first two years circuit court nominees have been confirmed nearly TWICE as fast as they were in President Obama’s first two years. In fact, President Trump and Leader McConnell have repeatedly bragged about their record-setting pace of confirmations.",0
"Great meeting with@CalState presidents to hear about the challenges they’re facing including students going hungry, affordable housing and rebuilding after wildfires. Also glad to see so many more women serving in the role of president. Keep up the good work!",0

It’s deeply disappointing that in 2019 women are still paid an average of 80 cents for every $1 that a white man makes. For women of color the gap is even wider. Congress must pass the #PaycheckFairnessAct and ensure women get #EqualPayForEqualWork.,0
That’s why my colleagues and I are calling on@USSoccer to do the right thing and pay these women what they’ve earned.@USWNT.,0
"The pay disparity between the women’s and men’s national soccer teams is indicative of the wage gap women face across the country. Despite being reigning world champions and bringing in more revenue than the men’s team, the women’s team is still paid far less.",0
"Californians are consistently under-represented when voting for president because of the Electoral College. Each elector stands for 712,000 Californians, but smaller states get the same vote for only 195,000 voters. That’s simply unfair. We must eliminate the Electoral College.",0
That’s why our bill requires housing to be paired with services to address those root causes. Local governments are already taking action to combat homelessness; this bill will help them be even more proactive and effective. Read more about our bill here https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=EED775F6-C820-404B-8A6B-4629A9893619 ….,0
"Homelessness has reached crisis levels in California. While our state is a model for the country in many ways, homelessness is one area where we must do better. Part of the challenge is that the root causes of homelessness vary & include mental illness, drug addiction & poverty.",0
"The census is fundamental to our democracy. From representation in Congress to federal funding, its effects are felt widely across the United States. That’s why the #2020Census must not be politicized by the Trump administration’s efforts to include a question on citizenship.",0
The gender wage gap persists in retirement. Retirement-age women on average have incomes that are 25% lower than those of men & they’re 80% more likely to be impoverished. That’s why we’ve introduced a bill to give women the resources they need to prepare for retirement.,0
"Much of the fentanyl in the U.S. comes from China, where it has been legal to produce. That’s why I’m glad to see that China is making all fentanyl and fentanyl analogues illegal.

"On #VietnamWarVeteransDay we thank all Americans who served during the Vietnam War. We recognize, and are thankful for, your service, courage and sacrifice.",0
It’s completely unacceptable that in 2019 our Constitution still doesn’t expressly guarantee gender equality. That’s why it’s imperative we pass the Equal Rights Amendment and ensure that all Americans are protected from gender-based discrimination https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=14B4C887-F7E5-465D-8FCE-AFF9577E244B ….,0

"Housing costs are crushing the middle class. Over 11 million Americans are spending more than half of their income on housing. That is outrageous. Today, I re-introduced the Rent Relief Act to ease the burden of rising rents and provide relief for those who need it the most.",0
This Administration has taken a punitive approach against vulnerable families who are fleeing the murder capitals of the world. This cruel policy of family separation is not a reflection of who we are or who we should be.,0
"As Attorney General of California, I took on the five biggest Wall Street banks during the financial crisis. We won $20 billion for California homeowners and together we passed the strongest anti-foreclosure law in the United States of America.",0

"Voting rights are under attack across the country. Let’s counteract that by strengthening access to the ballot box, expanding early voting, and making Election Day a national holiday.",0

10/ Simple conclusion: post release impact of dopamine at least in the PFC is temporally and spatially heterogeneous. This should allow dopamine to enable PFC to compute and generate spatiotemporally diverse but specialized outputs.,1
"9/The most impressive effect was on population response, with the biggest change on ensemble activity happening when dopamine neurons were stimulated in a sustained phasic pattern (which we see during tasks involving sustained attention or distant goals).",1
"8/ impact on individual PFC units was weak and incredibly heterogeneous. Essentially fast, slow, excitatory and inhibitory effects were seen on 10-20% of spontaneously active cells. And no significant phase-locking of these units with gamma.",1
"7/ what we found, in reverse order, was a surprising impact on PFC gamma (yes gamma, in the absence of GABA ) and gamma-theta coupling. This effect was related with stimulation pattern of dopamine neurons and basal activity of animals.",1
6/ we and others had done VTA + PFC combined recording during task performance but different tasks can engage multiple systems. Difference here was that we “removed” task interference by recording in satiated animals free to move in cage but not doing a task.,1
"5/ To begin to understand how dopamine influences computation of these temporally heterogenous functions, we stimulated VTA dopamine cells in different patterns (that we had previously seen them fire during typical “task” sessions) while recording units and LFPs in PFC.",1
"4/ in PFC those dopamine “functions” are temporally diverse ranging from ms-s for error signaling; many seconds for working memory, sustained attention, etc, and potentially sec-min for sustained motivation or anxiety.",1
3/ most of us dopamine-centric people (including my lab ) focus on dopamine cell firing and release. Those measures are important but ultimately dopamine mediated “functions” depend on how dopamine modifies cells/ensembles in postsynaptic targets.,1
2/ this was the first project for@SweytaLohani thesis She started it 6-7 years ago although it ended up being her third 1st authored paper (research just works that way). We are grateful to@IlanaWitten &@KarlDeisseroth who at the time sent us the freshly available th:cre rats.,1
